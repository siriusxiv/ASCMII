Here we'll explain how to deploy this web application on a server.

I would advise you to use Ubuntu 12.04.2 LTS (that's what worked for me).

First, install the following packages :

-install JDK 1.7
If you have another version of JRE or JDK beforehand, please uninstall it.
$　sudo apt-get install openjdk-7-jdk

/!\ You need to make absolutely sure that you are using JDK 1.7!
Type javac -version and java -version in a terminal to check that
there is no other version installed.

-install MySQL Server
$　sudo apt-get install mysql-server

-install MySQL Workbench
through Software Center

-install git
$　sudo apt-get install git


Installing play :
Download 2.2.0 version from play framework website
extract the zip archive to your home folder and type the following
commands in the terminal:
$ sudo mv play-2.2.0 /opt
$ sudo ln -s /opt/play-2.2.0 /opt/play
$ sudo ln -s /opt/play/play /usr/local/bin/play

(actually, moving play to the /opt folder is not compulsory, but you
must make a shortcut to play in /usr/local/bin to be able to use the
command "play" in the terminal)


Now that play and the necessary packages are installed, download the
sourcecode using git:
$  git clone https://github.com/siriusxiv/ASCMII

Then, you can launch the play application from the source.
To do that :
$  cd ASCMII
$  play

Then, you enter the play console, if everything proceeds as planned,
then you should see :
play! 2.2.0 (using Java 1.7.0_25 and Scala 2.10.2)
(there must be Java 1.7 there, if not, remove any instance of another
version of Java)

You can use the "run" command in the play console to test the application.
For example :
$  run
 or
$  run 1034 (if you want to change the port, default port is 9000)

Now you must edit the conf/application.conf file.
	Line 39 to 42 : configure default database
Then, from line 70 onwards, please configure the domain name, mail, ldap
and agap settings.
admin.mail contains the mail adress to which error reports are sent.
smtp.user contains the mail adress used to send mail through ASCMII.
test.user and test.pass contain the username and the password of the
account used to connect without LDAP (only used to test the application,
if you want to disabled this test mode, set test.enabled=no, otherwise
set test.enabled=yes). When test mode is on, mails are sent to admin.mail
only, and not to the users.
ldap.aspire lets you choose if you want to get all students and professors
from LDAP inside the database. I advise you to set it to no. Set it to yes
only the first time you run the application.

The other lines are self-explanatory.
Please note that if you were to input a colon ":", you must enclose
what you type in double quotes ".



Now you can deploy the application :
There are two ways to deploy the application.
Just enter the following command :
$  start -Dhttp.port=80
Where 80 is the port you'll use. If you don't specify the port, then
play will choose port 9000. Pay attention that the selected port is not
in use by another process.

Other way to deploy a play application :
There is a command :
$  dist
Play will automatically create a zip file containing an executable file
(named "start"). This executable file will create the server and does not
need play to be installed on the computer in use.


After the application is deployed, you must initialize the database.
Open ascmii.sql with MySQL Workbench.
Run the third line to create the database
	CREATE DATABASE ascmii;

Connect to http://localhost:PORT with your favorite web browser.
Click on the button to update the database (this will run an SQL
script that will create the tables and prepopulate the database).
The script that prepopulates the database can be found in
conf/evolutions/default/2.sql
(1.sql is automatically generated so there is no need to edit it)

When the app is started for the first time, you must get all the
students' information from LDAP inside the application MySQL database.
You must ensure that you remain connected to AGAP and LDAP.
	LDAP : so that one can log in
	AGAP : so that the you can get the attendees for each course and
the course list.

About AGAP, you must be sure that the people's uid is accessible.
To do that, you must run a script at the start of a new year so
that new students' uid be accessible.
You must ask the responsible for AGAP to do this (Mr Jean-Yves Martin).
