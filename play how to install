Here we'll explain how to deploy this web application on a server.

I would advise you to use Ubuntu 12.04.2 LTS (that's what worked for me).

First, install the following packages :

-install JDK 1.7
If you have another version of JRE or JDK beforehand, please uninstall it.
$　sudo apt-get install openjdk-7-jdk

/!\ You need to make absolutely sure that you are using JDK 1.7!
Type javac -version and java -version in a terminal to check that
there is no other version installed.

-install MySQL Server
$　sudo apt-get install mysql-server

-install MySQL Workbench
through Software Center

-install git
$　sudo apt-get install git


Installing play :
Download 2.1.3 version from play framework website
extract the zip archive to your home folder and type the following
commands in the terminal:
$ sudo mv play-2.1.3 /opt
$ sudo ln -s /opt/play-2.1.3 /opt/play
$ sudo ln -s /opt/play/play /usr/local/bin/play

(actually, moving play to the /opt folder is not compulsory, but you
must make a shortcut to play in /usr/local/bin to be able to use the
command "play" in the terminal)


Now that play and the necessary packages are installed, download the
sourcecode using git:
$  git clone https://github.com/siriusxiv/ASCMII

Then, you can launch the play application from the source.
To do that :
$  cd ASCMII
$  play

Then, you enter the play console, if everything proceeds as planned,
then you should see :
play! 2.1.3 (using Java 1.7.0_25 and Scala 2.10.0)
(there must be Java 1.7 there, if not, remove any instance of another
version of Java)

You can use the "run" command in the play console to test the application.
For example :
$  run
 or
$  run 1034 (if you want to change the port, default port is 9000)

Now you must edit the conf/application.conf file.
	Line 39 to 42 : configure default database
Then, from line 70 onwards, please configure the domain name, mail, ldap
and agap settings.
admin.mail contains the mail adress to which error reports are sent.
smtp.user contains the mail adress used to send mail through ASCMII.
The other lines are self-explanatory.
Please note that if you were to input a colon ":", you must enclose
what you type in double quotes ".

Now you can deploy the application :
There are two ways to deploy the application. Only one works for ASCMII
(see the end of this file for a detailed explanation).
Just enter the following command :
$  start -Dhttp.port=80
Where 80 is the port you'll use. If you don't specify the port, then
play will choose port 9000. Pay attention that the selected port is not
in use by another process.


After the application is deployed, you must initialize the database.
Open ascmii.sql with MySQL Workbench.
Run the third line to create the database
	CREATE DATABASE ascmii;

Connect to http://localhost:PORT with your favorite web browser.
Click on the button to update the database (this will run an SQL
script that will create the tables and prepopulate the database).

You can then run the last lines of the ascmii.sql file (it's just
sample questions that couldn't be create automatically by play because
their string was too long, so you must use MySQL Workbench to create
them).



Two ways to deploy a play application :
There is a command :
$  dist
Play will automatically create a zip file containing an executable file
(named "start"). This executable file will create the server and does not
need play to be installed on the computer in use. Though this method
seems better for deployment, it has a major drawback (that I was unable
to solve) :
	- The project files are all compiled in .jar files. So you cannot
add files after the app is deployed. I'll explain :
When you write a file in the server, you must choose a path. To get the path of
the folder in which the play application is stored, you must use the following
method :
	play.Play.application().path()
But this method does not work when you dist your app. (I didn't find a
roundabout way to avoid that)
As a result I've chosen not to use dist.

(This point is crucial for the upload of images)
