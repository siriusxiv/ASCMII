How ASCMII works : (you can generate javadoc for more details)

See the file named "deployment" to learn how to used the configuration file
conf/application.conf

ASCMII has the following packages :
	- (default package)
Contains only Global.java. Only used to override some play methods.
Allow the programmer to choose what the app does when starting for example.
Here, timers are started at the beginning, PostgreSQL drivers are loaded, etc.

	- controllers
Default Play package that contains everything related to sending data to
the connected host.
I tried to roughly create a class per displayed web page.
There are as well classes devoted to allow the user to download or upload files
(CSV or UploadImages for example)
P404 is a class that manages what the servers must do if the user types a wrong
GET request.
Ajax is a class that manages Ajax request only.

	- functions
Contains helping class for tasks managed by class in the package controller.
You can for example find AGAPUtil or LDAP, used to connect to PostgreSQL or LDAP
remote servers.
Events contains things related to time. For the time being, the only thing is there
is the methods that send mails to students (every 15 minutes, the server checks if
mails are to be sent)

	- functions.agap
Contains classes to assist AGAPUtil

	- models
Contains entities for ebean (ebean manages the default database)
Each class represents a table in the database.
But the class CoupleRI, Resultat and Mail are exceptions. I wanted to move them out
of this package but to no avail. I don't understand why, but play won't compile if I
change their package...

	- test
Only one class with only one method.
The aim is to check whether test mode is activated or not.

	- views
Contains html pages.
